## Introduction:


Welcome to the official repository for GalactaTEC, a reinvention of the classic arcade game, adapted and modernized by the TecGamesNow team using Unity. This project aims to revive the excitement of retro video games, integrating modern technology and a collaborative approach that allows multiple players to enjoy the experience together.

Project Description
GalactaTEC is more than just a game; it's a journey to the past with an eye on the future. In this title, players will take control of their own custom-designed spacecraft in intense battles that challenge both skill and strategy. The goal is clear: defeat the enemy ships through three dynamic and action-packed levels, where each level introduces new enemies and patterns.

Game Features
Multiplayer Mode: Designed for two players with individual controls, providing a shared and competitive experience.
Custom Design: Each player can customize their ship before combat, choosing from various designs and capabilities.
Advanced Interaction: Using Unity, we've ensured that every detail, from animation to sound effects, contributes to an immersive and realistic experience.
Innovative Mechanics: In addition to basic combat, players will be able to use protective shields and various types of shots to overcome challenges.
Technologies Used
Unity: All game development is carried out in Unity, leveraging its powerful graphics engine and efficient management of scenes and assets for 2D and 3D games.
External Controllers: Support for external controllers that enable more intuitive and exciting interaction.
